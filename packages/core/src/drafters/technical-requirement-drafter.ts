				question: `What is this technical requirement and what must it accomplish?

Be specific about capability, behavior, or quality attribute.

Good: "Rate limiting middleware preventing API abuse: 100 req/min per API key, burst 150. Must handle distributed scenarios across multiple servers."
Good: "DB connection pooling with auto-retry. Pool size 10-50 based on load, 5s timeout, max 3 retries with exponential backoff."
Bad: "Make API better" (what? how?)`,
				answer: null,
			},
			{
				id: "q-002",
				question: `Why is this needed? What problem does it solve?

Connect to concrete impacts: performance, reliability, security, maintainability, scale, cost.

Good: "3 DDoS incidents this quarter cost $50k in AWS overages. Single actor can overwhelm API, affecting all customers. Need abuse prevention while allowing legitimate high-volume use."
Good: "Connection-per-request hits DB max (100) under peak load, causing 503s. Setup overhead adds 50-100ms per request. Pooling reduces latency and prevents exhaustion."
Bad: "Best practice" (doesn't explain actual problem)`,
				answer: null,
			},
			{
				id: "q-003",
				question: `What's the high-level technical approach?

Consider: key components, technologies, integration points, data flow, patterns.

Good: "Redis for distributed rate limiting state. Middleware intercepts requests, checks Redis counter with sliding window (fairer than fixed). Return 429 + Retry-After if exceeded. Background job expires old keys hourly."
Good: "pg-pool library. Initialize at startup, expose via singleton. Repository requests connections from pool, returns after query. Health check monitors stats, alerts if >80% exhausted."
Bad: "Use a library" (which? how integrated?)`,
				answer: null,
				optional: true,
			},
			{
				id: "q-004",
				question: `Which business requirement drives this? (BRD ID, or explain if tech-debt/infrastructure)

Good: "brd-042-checkout-optimization"
Good: "Tech debt - migrating from deprecated library"
Good: "Infrastructure - preparing for 10x scale"
Bad: "Someone asked for it" (not specific)`,

				question: `Relevant architectural decisions? (DEC IDs comma-separated, or 'none')

Good: "dec-015-microservices-strategy, dec-021-redis-for-state"
Good: "none"

				question: `Research library/framework documentation and record findings.

GOAL: Understand API capabilities, configuration options, limitations, and best practices to inform implementation approach and identify potential issues early.

Perform research and document what you learned:

Good: "Researched Redis sorted sets. Findings: EXPIRE doesn't work on members, must use ZREMRANGEBYSCORE for TTL. Recommend background job every 1hr to cleanup. Memory limit via maxmemory-policy=volatile-lru. Max 2^32 members safe."
Good: "Researched pg-pool. Findings: Max pool size = (CPU cores Ã— 2) + disk spindles. Idle timeout default 10s. Must call client.release() or leaks occur. Pool.end() gracefully drains. Recommend 20 max, 5 min, 30s idle."
Good: "Researched Stripe webhooks. Findings: Signature in Stripe-Signature header using HMAC-SHA256. 5min tolerance window. Retry 3 days with exponential backoff. Must respond 2xx within 30sec or marked failed."
Good: "none - using standard libraries without special configuration needs"

Tool guidance:
- Use doc lookup tools for official docs: React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe, AWS, Express
- Fallback to web search if doc tools unavailable
- Record actual findings: limits, gotchas, recommended configs, best practices`,

Types: Performance (latency, throughput), Scale (users, volume, rate), Reliability (uptime, recovery), Security (auth, compliance), Integration (existing systems), Technology (languages, platforms), Cost (budget, ops costs)

Each should be specific and measurable. Aim for 2-6.

						question: `Describe constraint (specific, measurable) and explain why it exists.

Include: CONSTRAINT (with numbers/thresholds) + RATIONALE (what drives it)

Good: "API p95 <100ms under 10k users. Why: SLA guarantees to enterprise customers, breach causes penalties. Current 150ms causing complaints."

						question: `Research industry benchmarks/standards and record findings.

GOAL: Validate constraint is aligned with industry standards, ensure compliance requirements are met, and benchmark against recognized best practices to avoid under/over-engineering.

Perform research and document what you learned:

Good: "Researched OWASP API Security. Findings: Recommends 10-100 req/min for unauthenticated, 100-1000 for authenticated. Use 429 status with Retry-After header. Implement rate limiting at edge/gateway level. Our 100 req/min aligns with standard."
Good: "Researched Core Web Vitals. Findings: LCP <2.5s (good), 2.5-4s (needs improvement), >4s (poor). FID <100ms (good). Our <2sec target exceeds 'good' threshold. Mobile 4G typically 3-5s, so ambitious but achievable."
Good: "Researched PCI-DSS 4.0. Findings: Requirement 3.4 mandates encryption at rest (AES-256). Requirement 8.3 requires MFA for admin access. Requirement 10.2 requires audit logging all access. Our constraints cover 3.4 and 8.3, need to add 10.2."
Good: "none - internal business constraint with no applicable industry standard"

Tool guidance:
- Use web search for: OWASP, WCAG, PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO, NIST standards
- Record specific findings: thresholds, requirements, implementation guidelines, gaps
- Include version/date: "WCAG 2.1 AA", "PCI-DSS 4.0"`,

How will you verify successful implementation? Consider: Functional tests, Performance tests, Security tests, Integration tests, Reliability tests, Ops readiness (monitoring/logs/docs), Code quality

Good: "k6 load test 10k users maintains p95 <100ms for 10min. Why: SLA requires 100ms under peak, breach causes penalties."
