GOAL: Validate problem/opportunity with market data, understand competitive landscape, benchmark desired outcomes against industry standards.

Document what you learned:

Good: "Researched industry study on user flows. Findings: Average abandonment 70%. Top reason: unexpected friction (48%). Streamlined flow increases conversion 20-30%. Mobile abandonment 85% vs 73% desktop. Our 40% is better than average. 15% improvement target achievable but ambitious."
Good: "Analyzed competitor approaches. Findings: Leader A uses saved preferences. Competitor B reduced steps from 5 to 2, shows +18% conversion. Both use autocomplete. Pattern: minimize fields, save preferences, show progress. Validates our approach."
Good: "Researched user abandonment causes. Findings: Account requirement: 24% abandon. Complex flow: 18%. Slow load: 11%. Trust concerns: 18%. Solutions: optional account, progress indicator, trust signals, <2sec load. Validates our criteria list."
Good: "none - internal operational requirement with no market comparison"

Tool guidance:
- Use web search for industry reports, analyst firms, competitor analysis
- Record concrete findings: percentages, conversion rates, user behaviors, competitor features
- Note how findings validate or adjust targets and approach`,
