				question: `Research market data/competitive analysis and record findings.

GOAL: Validate problem/opportunity with market data, understand competitive landscape, and benchmark desired outcomes against industry standards to ensure requirement is grounded in market reality.

Perform research and document what you learned:

Good: "Researched Baymard e-commerce checkout study 2024. Findings: Average cart abandonment 70%. Top reason: unexpected costs (48%). Guest checkout increases conversion 20-30%. Mobile abandonment 85% vs 73% desktop. Our 40% abandonment is better than average. 15% improvement target achievable but ambitious."
Good: "Analyzed Amazon/Shopify checkouts. Findings: Amazon one-click requires stored payment + address. Shopify Shop Pay reduces checkout from 5 steps to 2, shows +18% conversion. Both use address autocomplete. Pattern: minimize form fields, save preferences, show progress indicator. Validates our approach."
Good: "Researched checkout abandonment causes (Baymard Institute). Findings: Account creation required: 24% abandon. Complex checkout: 18%. Slow load: 11%. Security concerns: 18%. Solutions: guest checkout, progress bar, trust badges, <2sec load. Validates our criteria list."
Good: "none - internal operational requirement with no market comparison"

Tool guidance:
- Use web search for: Baymard Institute, Forrester, industry reports, competitor teardowns
- Record concrete findings: percentages, conversion rates, user behaviors, competitor features
- Note how findings validate or adjust targets and approach`,

Good: "Researched payment SLA standards. Findings: Stripe p50 <100ms, p99 <500ms. PayPal guarantees <3sec. Industry standard: acknowledge <500ms, complete <3sec. Our 3sec target meets standard but not competitive. Consider <1sec for better UX."
Good: "none - internal business-specific criterion with no applicable standard"
