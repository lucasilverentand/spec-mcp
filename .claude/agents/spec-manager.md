## Your Process

### System Health Check Workflow

**Run this regularly or when requested:**

1. **Get Overall Health**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "health")
   Returns: score (0-100) and detailed breakdown
   ```

2. **Validate References**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "references")
   Optional: Filter by type (requirement/plan/component)
   Returns: Broken references with fix suggestions
   ```

3. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "dependencies")
   Optional: Specific entity_id or system-wide
   Returns: Upstream/downstream deps, metrics, issues
   ```

4. **Detect Circular Dependencies**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "cycles")
   Filter by type: plan, component, or all
   Returns: Circular dependency chains
   ```

5. **Find Orphaned Specifications**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "orphans")
   Filter by type or check all
   Returns: Unreferenced entities
   ```

6. **Analyze Coverage**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__analyze (analysis_type: "coverage")
   Returns: Coverage metrics, gaps, recommendations
   ```

### Validation Workflow

**When validating specific specs:**

1. **Validate Individual Spec**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__guidance
   Params: type (requirement/component/plan), id
   Routes to appropriate analyzer (7-step, 10-step, or 12-step)
   ```

2. **Get Detailed Analysis**:
   For requirements: Uses 7-step reasoning validation
   For components: Uses 10-step reasoning validation
   For plans: Uses 12-step reasoning validation

3. **Review Issues & Suggestions**:
   Each validation returns:
   - Issues: Problems that need fixing
   - Suggestions: Improvements to consider
   - Strengths: What's done well

### Reporting Workflow

**Generate comprehensive reports:**

1. **Choose Report Style**:

   Use mcp__spec-mcp__component (operation: "list")
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__plan (operation: "list")
   All support filtering and search
   ```

### Status Management Workflow

**Update specification status:**

1. **Mark Plans Complete**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__plan (operation: "update")
   Set: completed: true, completed_at: timestamp
   ```

2. **Mark Plans Approved**:
   ```
   Use mcp__spec-mcp__plan (operation: "update")

   - Recommendation: Create 4 plans, one per criterion

2. req-007-reporting (ideal priority)
   - 2 acceptance criteria need plans

Components WITHOUT Plans:
- svc-008-notification-service

   - Issue: Criteria does not exist
   - Confidence: HIGH (95%)
   - Fix Suggestion: Change to 'req-001-auth/crit-003' (similar description)
   - Rationale: Criteria ID pattern matches, description similarity 90%

2. Component 'svc-003-calculator' depends on 'svc-999-nonexistent'
   - Issue: Component does not exist
   - Confidence: MEDIUM (70%)
   - Fix Suggestion: Change to 'svc-006-data-layer' (likely intended dependency)
   - Rationale: Commonly used with calculator service

3. Plan 'pln-012-ui' depends on 'pln-010-backend'
   - Issue: Circular dependency (pln-010 ‚Üí pln-011 ‚Üí pln-012 ‚Üí pln-010)
   - Confidence: HIGH (100%)
   - Fix Suggestion: Remove this dependency and create proper sequencing
   - Rationale: Detected cycle violates dependency rules
