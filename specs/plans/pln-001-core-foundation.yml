description: Establish the foundational architecture for the MCP specification management system,
  including data schemas, entity management, file storage, and validation engine. This plan focuses
  on building the core libraries that all other components will depend on.

priority: critical
acceptance_criteria: All foundational libraries are implemented with complete test coverage,
  validation engine correctly enforces schema constraints, file-based storage reliably persists and
  retrieves specifications, and entity manager provides CRUD operations for all spec types.
