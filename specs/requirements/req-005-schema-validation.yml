description: "The system must enforce strict schema validation using Zod for all specification
  types. Validation must occur at multiple layers: input validation for tool parameters, entity
  validation during CRUD operations, and business rules validation for domain-specific constraints.
  Validation errors must be clear, actionable, and indicate exactly which fields failed validation
  and why, including suggestions for correction when possible."
