name: JWT Authentication API Endpoint
description: "JWT-based user authentication API endpoint: Accept email/password credentials, validate against database, return signed JWT token with 24h expiration. Must handle rate limiting (5 attempts per email per 15 minutes) and return appropriate error codes for invalid credentials, locked accounts, or rate limit exceeded."
priority: high

technical_context: "Current session-based auth requires server-side session storage, causing scaling issues across multiple instances. Users experience random logouts during deployments. Moving to stateless JWT auth enables horizontal scaling, reduces database load by 40%, and provides seamless experience across server instances. Security improvement: tokens can be validated without database lookup."
implementation_approach: "POST /api/auth/login endpoint using Express.js middleware. Flow: validate input schema, query user from PostgreSQL by email, verify password with bcrypt, check Redis rate limit counter (increment with 15min TTL), generate JWT using jsonwebtoken library with user ID and role claims, return token + refresh token. Rate limiting uses sliding window pattern in Redis. Token validation middleware on protected routes verifies signature and expiration."

constraints:
  - type: performance
    description: "API p95 <200ms response time. Why: Mobile app timeout is 3s, need headroom for network latency. Current session-based auth averages 250ms causing poor UX."

  - type: scalability
    description: "Support 1000 concurrent requests. Why: Mobile app launch projecting 100k DAU, 1% peak concurrency typical for auth operations during morning login surge."

  - type: infrastructure
    description: "99.9% uptime SLA. Why: Authentication is critical path for all app features. Downtime blocks all user activity. Industry standard for consumer apps."

  - type: security
    description: "OWASP Top 10 compliance required. Why: Security audit requirement for enterprise customers. Must prevent injection attacks, broken auth, XSS, CSRF per OWASP guidelines."

implementation_notes: Infrastructure - scaling preparation for mobile app launch expecting 100k users
criteria:
  - id: crit-001
    description: Load test 1000 concurrent users maintains p95 <200ms for 5min
    rationale: Validates scale constraint for mobile launch, prevents performance degradation under peak load

  - id: crit-002
    description: Rate limiting blocks 6th login attempt within 15min returns 429 with retry-after header
    rationale: Prevents brute force attacks, validates security constraint

  - id: crit-003
    description: Invalid credentials return 401 with generic error message
    rationale: OWASP compliance prevents user enumeration attacks

  - id: crit-004
    description: Security scan zero critical vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP
    rationale: Compliance requirement, blocks deployment if critical vulns present

  - id: crit-005
    description: 85% code coverage on auth logic verified by Jest
    rationale: Prevents regressions in critical security code path

  - id: crit-006
    description: All endpoints emit Prometheus metrics for latency, error rate, request count
    rationale: Enables monitoring and alerting for production issues
