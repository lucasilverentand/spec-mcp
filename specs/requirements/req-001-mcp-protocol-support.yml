description: The system must implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification to enable AI
  assistants to interact with the specification management system. This includes implementing the
  stdio transport layer, tool registration and execution, prompt registration for guided workflows,
  and proper error handling following MCP conventions. The implementation must be compatible with
  MCP SDK version 1.18.2+ and support both synchronous and asynchronous tool execution patterns.
