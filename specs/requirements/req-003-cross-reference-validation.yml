name: Cross-Reference Validation
description: The system must validate all cross-references between specifications to ensure data
  integrity and prevent broken links. This includes validating that requirement criteria reference
  valid plan IDs, plan tasks reference valid component IDs, component dependencies reference
  existing components, and detecting circular dependencies. Validation must occur at both creation
  time and during analysis operations, providing clear error messages indicating which references
  are invalid.
