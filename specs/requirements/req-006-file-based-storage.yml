name: File-Based YAML Storage
description: The system must persist all specifications as human-readable YAML files organized in a
  structured directory hierarchy (requirements/, components/, plans/). File operations must be
  atomic to prevent corruption, support concurrent access safely, maintain file metadata
  (timestamps), and provide efficient file scanning for large repositories. The system must handle
  file I/O errors gracefully and provide clear error messages for permission issues or disk space
  problems.
