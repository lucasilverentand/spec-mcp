description: The system must provide interactive MCP prompts that guide users through creating
  well-structured specifications following best practices. Prompts should implement the 7-step
  requirements process, 10-step components process, and 12-step plans process as documented in the
  guides. Each prompt should ask contextual questions, validate responses, provide examples and
  suggestions, and ultimately generate properly formatted specifications that pass validation.
