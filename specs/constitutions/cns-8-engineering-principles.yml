    title: Library-First Principle
    principle: Evaluate existing libraries before building custom solutions. Prefer battle-tested tools for non-core functionality like auth, payments, and data processing.
    rationale: Custom JWT library had security bypass. Libraries reduce vulnerabilities and speed delivery by eliminating development time for non-core features.

    title: Mandatory Code Reviews
    principle: All code changes require review by at least one other engineer before merging. Reviewers must verify functionality, tests, and code quality.
    rationale: Multiple production bugs from unreviewed code. Code reviews catch bugs early, share knowledge, and maintain quality standards across the team.
