    title: Code Quality Standards
    principle: All code must follow the established style guide and pass linting checks before merging. Code should be self-documenting with clear variable names and necessary comments for complex logic.
    rationale: Consistent code quality reduces technical debt, makes code easier to maintain and review, and ensures that any team member can understand and work with any part of the codebase efficiently.
    examples:
      - Using ESLint with Prettier for JavaScript projects
      - Implementing pre-commit hooks to enforce linting
    exceptions:
      - Prototype code for proof-of-concept explorations

    title: Testing Requirements
    principle: All new features must include unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage. Critical paths and business logic require integration tests.
    rationale: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions, increases confidence in deployments, serves as living documentation, and enables safe refactoring of the codebase.
    examples:
      - Jest tests for React components
