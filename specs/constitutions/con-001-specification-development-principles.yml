    title: Requirements First
    principle: All features must be traced back to documented requirements with measurable acceptance criteria
    rationale: This ensures we build what's needed and can verify success objectively
    examples:
      - Before implementing a login feature, document the authentication requirement with specific
        security criteria
      - Link each plan task to a specific requirement criterion
    exceptions:
      - Bug fixes may skip requirement creation if they restore documented behavior
      - Performance optimizations targeting specific metrics

    title: Specification Traceability
    principle: Every plan must link to requirement criteria, and every component must trace to requirements
    rationale: Traceability prevents scope creep and ensures all work delivers value
    examples:
      - Plans reference criteria_id from requirements
      - Components document which requirements they satisfy
    exceptions: []

    title: Incremental Validation
    principle: Specifications should be validated at each step before moving forward
    rationale: Early validation prevents compounding errors and rework
    examples:
      - Validate requirement description before adding criteria
      - Check component boundaries before defining interfaces
    exceptions:
      - Exploratory prototypes may defer validation until proof-of-concept
